## 🚀 Project Overview

EduSense revolutionizes classroom management by combining real-time biometric facial recognition with advanced machine learning for predictive risk assessment. Using 128-D biometric signatures for automated attendance and transparent SHAP insights for early academic warning, the platform provides role-based smart dashboards and multi-channel auto alerts (SMS, WhatsApp, and Email) to ensure a seamless, data-driven ecosystem for student success and proactive intervention.

### Core Technologies
*   **Biometric Attendance**: Real-time facial recognition using 128-D biometric signatures for high-accuracy identification.
*   **Risk Prediction**: ML models (XGBoost + Random Forest) identifying at-risk students with deep SHAP insights for proactive intervention.
*   **Smart Dashboards**: Role-based control centers providing real-time intelligence for HODs, Faculty, and Students.
*   **Auto Alerts**: Multi-channel notifications via SMS, WhatsApp, and Email to ensure a fast response loop.
